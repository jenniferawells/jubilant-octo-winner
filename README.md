DriverPass wants a system that will provide online learning access and allow users to manage reservations for driving lessons according to packages that will be available for purchase.

Being able to capture in detail the client's requirements is where I feel I peformed really well.

I found that clearly defining all the relationships on my UML diagrams were tricky. While I know the clear relationships between some objects/actors, I feel that there possibly could have been a better way of depicting these relationships in a more concise way. 

I used a mix of qualitative and quantitative data to understand the user's needs and provide a solution. This data helps to focus on the real needs of the user, provide a positive user experience and to help them complete a task to get to the right outcome.

Considering the user's needs aim to provide positive experiences that keep a user loyal to a product or brand. A meaningful user experience allows to define customer journeys on a product that are most conducive to business success. 

I approach designing software with a function-oriented design approach.  This strategy breaks down the system into smaller functions.
The process starts by diagramming the flow of data through the system, then how the functions change data and the state of the entire system, breaking the system down into smaller units and then describing each function at large.
Naturally, this approach inherits other properties of other strategies, such as the divide and conquer methodology of the structured design strategy.
